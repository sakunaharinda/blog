Accurate action localization requires utilization of both temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using computationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream architectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time, online applications.</p><p>To accomplish activity localization under highly challenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient key-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then introduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action tubes temporally in the presence of occlusions.<br>Further, we eliminate the need for a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information into a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from both types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using a structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive optical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP of <strong>74.7% </strong>on the challenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of &#xA0;<strong>6.4% </strong>over the previous best online methods. We also achieve state-of-the-art video-mAP results compared to both online and offline methods. Moreover, our model achieves a frame rate of &#xA0;<strong>41.8</strong> FPS, which is a <strong>10.7%</strong> improvement over contemporary real-time methods.</p><p>Over method of activity recognition is superior to the current existing research, because of several reasons.</p><ul><li>We utilize key-point based detection architecture for the first time for the task of ST action localization, which reduces model complexity and inference time over traditional anchor-box based approaches.</li><li>We demonstrate that the explicit computation of OF is unnecessary, and that the SSIM index map obtains sufficient inter-frame temporal information.</li><li>We show that the highly redundant two-stream architecture is unnecessary by providing a single network with both spatial and temporal information, and allowing it to extract necessary information through discriminative learning.</li><li>We introduce an efficient tube-linking algorithm that extrapolates the tubes for a short period of time using past detections for real-time deployment.<br></li></ul><p>Our proposed architecture can be shown as follows.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/NewArchitecture.png" class="kg-image" alt="KORSAL: Key-point Detection based Online Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Action Localization" loading="lazy" width="1899" height="627" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/NewArchitecture.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/NewArchitecture.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/NewArchitecture.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/NewArchitecture.png 1899w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To obtain temporal information using SSIM Index Map, we used the following architecture.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/SSIM_Calc.png" class="kg-image" alt="KORSAL: Key-point Detection based Online Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Action Localization" loading="lazy" width="1899" height="704" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/SSIM_Calc.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/SSIM_Calc.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/SSIM_Calc.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/SSIM_Calc.png 1899w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this paper, we proposed a method to solve the challenging problem of <strong>online</strong> and <strong>real-time </strong>spatio-temporal action localization by utilizing simple and efficient key-point based detection architectures. We further improved upon existing linking algorithms to maintain temporal continuity by extrapolating the future positions of action tubes to compensate for missed detections online. We showed that the pre-computation of OF to capture motion information affects real-time performance, and we integrated temporal and appearance feature extraction into a single network. We demonstrated that our approach is able to run faster and achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on the UCF101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets.</p><p>Further extensions of this work can explore an integrated tube-linking algorithm and faster feature extraction backbones. Moreover, temporally aware feature extraction can also be investigated.</p><p>If you want to know more details about the research, you can visit the following link and checkout our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03319.pdf">research paper</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Cloud Platform 101]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="core-infrastructure-%E2%80%94-introduction">Core Infrastructure &#x2014; Introduction</h2><p></p><p>Google cloud platform (GCP) is a platform offered by Google with main 4 services run on the infrastructure that Google uses for some well known applications such as Youtube and Google Search.What are these 4 main kinds?<br></p><ul><li>Compute&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;App Engine, Compute Engine,</li></ul>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/google-cloud-platform-101/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">61abc07f6e3de41686ad0e4a</guid><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sakuna Jayasundara]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 19:39:55 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="core-infrastructure-%E2%80%94-introduction">Core Infrastructure &#x2014; Introduction</h2><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw.png" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101"><p></p><p>Google cloud platform (GCP) is a platform offered by Google with main 4 services run on the infrastructure that Google uses for some well known applications such as Youtube and Google Search.What are these 4 main kinds?<br></p><ul><li>Compute&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;App Engine, Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions etc..</li><li>Storage&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Cloud Storage, Cloud Big Table, Cloud Datastore, Persistent Disk etc..</li><li>Big Data&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Big Query, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataprep, Cloud Composer</li><li>Machine Learning&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Cloud, AutoML, Cloud TPU, Cloud Vision API, Cloud Natural Language, Cloud Speech to Text, Cloud Video Intelligance etc..</li></ul><p>In this article I&#x2019;m giving the basic idea about what GCP is and how is it organized.We will be discussing about aforementioned four kinds in more details in my future articles.So let&#x2019;s move forward.</p><h4 id="what-is-cloud-computing">What is Cloud Computing ?</h4><p>Today world is massively depending on &#x201C;Cloud Computing&#x201D;. So what&#x2019;s exactly is this Cloud Computing? Here is the definition.</p><blockquote><em>&#x201C; Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.&#x201D;&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;</em> <strong>Peter M. Mell</strong> <strong>Timothy Grance</strong></blockquote><p>Seems pretty hard to understand. Isn&#x2019;t it? &#x1F609;</p><p>So the basic idea of cloud computing is a way of using I.T. with following important traits.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="641" height="361" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png 641w"></figure><p>You can allocate resources as much as you want without any human intervention. Only you have to do is to use an interface, then you will get all the facilities such as storage and processing power. You can access your allocated resources any where in the world. May be your allocated resources are located in a different part of the world. </p><p>Elasticity is a very important facility. You can scale your resources as you want quickly and more importantly you pay for what you are using. If you are not using a resource anymore, you don&#x2019;t pay.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s it .. !! You know now the basic idea of cloud computing with GCP.</p><p>There are several GCP computing architectures. You can use any of them as per your requirement.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="646" height="365" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png 646w"></figure><ul><li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Provides raw compute,storage and network facilities and you have to pay what you allocate.</li><li>PaaS (Platform as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;This binds the application code to libraries that allows you to access the resources what your application needs and you pay what you use.</li><li>Saas (Software as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Many applications like Gmail,Google Drive and othre GSuit applications based on this architecture</li></ul><p>You do not need to worry about the resource provisioning at all !!</p><p>In network perspective, did you know the 40% of day-to-day internet traffic is handled by Google? Google network is designed to provide customers the highest possible throughput while providing the lowest possible latency. To provide such an amazing throughput and latency Google uses so called &#x201C;Edge Network system&#x201D; to cite content near the end users.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see how the GCP is organized.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="647" height="368" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png 647w"></figure><p>Zone is the deployment area of the GCP.When you want to run a Virtual Machine (VM) in GCP, that would be placed on a zone you defined. Region is created using several zones. Regions are located in several geographical locations with round trip network latency under 5ms !! If you need to establish an application with high availability you should establish your application in multiple zones.That allows you to provide the service continuously without any failure. Google provides multi region resource allocation facility. Which means your resources are located at least two geographically different locations which are 160 km apart. The most important thing is you can use resources located in multiple regions for the sake of virtualization.</p><p>Google always thinks about the environment too.Running many servers full of resources requires very high power consumption(approx. 2% of world electricity).For that google build their data centers near regenerative energy sources like sea and 100% carbon neutral since 2007. A great example provides by the data center located in Finland.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-Q2gALaR8Qkb-boBWCiHwBA.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"><figcaption>Data center in Finland</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, We&#x2019;ve reached to the end of &#xA0;the introduction to GCP article. Before I end this, let&#x2019;s talk about the security of the GCP.</p><p>Since millions of users use GCP, security is essential. Google make their own custom servers with a high hardware security chip named &#x201C;Titan&#x201D;. These servers use cryptographic signatures to make sure the correct software is booted. There are several layers of security in these servers which can be accessed by a very few of google employees.Then how the servers communicate each other securely? For that google uses a cryptographic remote procedure called data-on-the network. GCP encrypts all our PC traffic while flowing. In the Google logging page you need more than your username and password.Google uses an intelligent system to challenge users for additional information based on several risk factors such as a device logged in your account in a suspicious time and in a different location. Google allows you to use two-factor authorization to sign in. Inside the google infrastructure the intelligence system warns you about any suspicious activity.Not only that google conducts Red team exercises and simulated attacks to test and improve the responsiveness of the system.Every account needs U2F key to avoid phishing attacks.So you have nothing to worry about your security anymore.Google handles all !!</p><p>So we have discussed about some basics and techniques that we should know when we step into the GCP world. Let&apos;s talk more about GCP later. Till then Good Bye !!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
