As the title suggests, it is FPGA based processor implementation done to downsample an image. So let&apos;s dive in.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The goal of this project is to design a microprocessor for a specified task and the Central Processing Unit (CPU) structure, while simulating it using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog and to implement the given task using a programmable logic device, preferably a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). This report contains documents regarding the structure of the microprocessor and CPU design, the Verilog codes used to configure it and finally the physical configuration of the hardware.</p><ul><li><strong>Central Processing Unit</strong><br>Central Processing Unit (CPU) widely considered as the brain of any computer device, is the place where all the instructions are carried out by performing logical operations, arithmetic operations, control operations and input/output operations. Hence, as explained above, CPU contains of two main components, the processor and the control unit while having a memory component and I/O components connecting to the CPU separately.</li><li><strong>Microprocessor </strong><br>Microprocessor can be considered as the most important part when it comes to a CPU. It is responsible for processing a unique set of instructions and processes. Its design is responsible to carry out logical and arithmetic operations. Microprocessors consists of many integrated circuits which holds thousands of components such as transistors etc.<br><br>Microprocessors are very important figures when it comes to modern computer designs and applications. With the high usage of microprocessors in the current market, various types of task- oriented microprocessors are available today. In this project we plan to design and implement a specific task-oriented microprocessor with maximum optimization.<br></li></ul><p>Project contains 3 main parts. </p><ul><li><strong>Sending the serial encoded pixel values to the FPGA and storing process</strong><br>Image is transmitted to the FPGA using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) with 50MHz clock frequency. Image is sent by byte by byte serially using 4 states. They are START, IDLE, DATA, STOP. We built a python kernel using several libraries such as pyserial to communicate with RS232 port of the FPGA via the serial cable. After the image is sent to the FPGA we are notified by a LED. Then the process is triggered by a flag which is sent from the data memory module we built.<br><br>Since there were some errors when it comes to saving bits and storing them, we chose not to use the UART module and use the in-memory module for the data transfer process.<br><br>After the process is finished state of the processor is changed to the transmit state from process state. Then the UART transmitter is activated and it sends the processed down sampled image back to the computer for comparing and displaying purposes.<br><br>We can use any size of image in the architecture we&#x2019;re proposing, and pixel values will then be saved into the primary memory in the processor architecture. For the calculations and processing tasks in the latter sections, the values saved in these memory locations will be used.</li><li><strong>Down-sampling process</strong><br>With the values stored in the primary memory of the CPU, we begin our processing part by filtering the image using a gaussian kernel. The filtered image values will be saved in the remaining memory slots of the main memory of the CPU. Then we begin our down-sampling process and according to the instructions that have been pre-defined by us, the processor will carry them out and finally save the down-sampled image in the main memory, overlapping the original image at the first place. The down-sampling process will be given in order to the microprocessor by us according to an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that is being developed uniquely to our microprocessor. Each instruction in the ISA will contain few micro instructions and they will be fetched accordingly form the Instruction Register according to the algorithm we&#x2019;ve developed. The ISA and each registers task will be discussed later in this report.</li><li><strong>Transmitting the result back to the user</strong><br>The down sampled image will be sent back to the user in a similar manner used in transmitting the image. </li></ul><h2 id="instruction-set-architecture">Instruction Set Architecture </h2><p>As explained above, the main task of this processor is to down-sample any given image by a factor of two. In this section, we&#x2019;ll look at the architecture we have implemented to acquire this task and the use of all the special case and general case registers.</p><ul><li><strong>PC - </strong>A 10-bit Program Counter which keeps the main memory address of the next instruction to be fetched.</li><li><strong>IR - </strong>A 32-bit Instruction Register which holds the Instructions fetched.</li><li><strong>MAR - </strong>A 32-bit register</li><li><strong>AC - </strong>A 32-bit Accumulator which saves the intermediate values after a &#xA0; computation and the pixels values to be written/ read from data memory</li><li><strong>SOR - </strong>A 32-bit register which points the source location of the pixel</li><li><strong>DSTR - </strong>A 32-bit register which points the destination location of the pixel.</li><li><strong>COUN - </strong>A 32-bit register which is used for incrementing purposes.</li><li><strong>R1 - </strong>A 32-bit register used for general purpose and to store constant data </li><li><strong>R2 - </strong>A 32-bit register used for general purpose and to store constant data</li><li><strong>R3 - </strong>A 32-bit register used for general purpose and to store constant data</li></ul><h3 id="datapath">Datapath<br></h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.22.07.png" class="kg-image" alt="FPGA Based Processor Implementation" loading="lazy" width="902" height="1112" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.22.07.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.22.07.png 902w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Datapath of the Processor</figcaption></figure><h3 id="process-cycle">Process Cycle</h3><p>The processing of the written algorithm happens in 3 stages which are fetch, decode and execute. In this section we&#x2019;ll take a brief look at these 3 stages and the operation of all these stages.</p><ul><li><strong>Fetch Instructions</strong><br>FETCH cycle consists of 2 stages with FETCH1 being set as the next state at the beginning.<br>FETCH1: Instruction Read <br>FETCH2: IR &lt;- M, PC &lt;- PC+1</li><li><strong>Decode Instructions</strong><br>After the instruction has been fetched, processor needs to identify which instruction has been fetched to invoke the correct execute cycle. During the decode cycle, processor identifies the execution cycle by the opcode of the instruction and passes down to the execute cycle to carry out the rest of the operation.</li><li><strong>Execute Instruction</strong><br>Execute instructions are the main types of instructions that carry out the major parts of the processing. The execute instructions can be classified according to the tasks they perform.</li></ul><p>You can get a clear understanding about the instructions and their functionalities in the <a href="https://github.com/ShechemKS/DownSampling_Processor/blob/master/Pocessor%20Design%20Report.pdf">project report</a>. </p><p>Finally, the state diagram of the complete process looked like this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.32.41.png" class="kg-image" alt="FPGA Based Processor Implementation" loading="lazy" width="1766" height="610" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.32.41.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.32.41.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.32.41.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.32.41.png 1766w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>State Diagram of the Processor</figcaption></figure><h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2><p>The algorithm for the image down-sampling process consists of two main sections which are the filtering of the image and the down-sampling itself. First, the filtering algorithm is applied to the whole image by selecting 3x1 and 1x3 pixel sets and then the down-sampling algorithm is applied. More details about each of these algorithms will be explained below.</p><h3 id="filtering-algorithm">Filtering Algorithm</h3><p>Filtering is done by using a gaussian kernel. Instead of using a 3x3, 2-D gaussian kernel, we opt kernel separability where 2 kernels that are 1x3 and 3x1 run through the image as shown below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.35.41.png" class="kg-image" alt="FPGA Based Processor Implementation" loading="lazy" width="1090" height="200" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.35.41.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.35.41.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-00.35.41.png 1090w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Filter Kernels</figcaption></figure><p>The main reason for the above selection was to make the algorithm more simple and easy to understand. At first vertical filtering was carried out and horizontal filtering was carried out on resultant image after the vertical filtering. Finally after the two filtrations, pixel values of the image were saved in the main memory. The weighted average was calculated by multiplying the pixel value and kernel value and adding the three likewise values together and dividing it by the weighted average of the kernel, which is 4 in both.

Accurate action localization requires utilization of both temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using computationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream architectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time, online applications.</p><p>To accomplish activity localization under highly challenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient key-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then introduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action tubes temporally in the presence of occlusions.<br>Further, we eliminate the need for a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information into a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from both types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using a structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive optical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP of <strong>74.7% </strong>on the challenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of &#xA0;<strong>6.4% </strong>over the previous best online methods.

We further improved upon existing linking algorithms to maintain temporal continuity by extrapolating the future positions of action tubes to compensate for missed detections online. We showed that the pre-computation of OF to capture motion information affects real-time performance, and we integrated temporal and appearance feature extraction into a single network. We demonstrated that our approach is able to run faster and achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on the UCF101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets.</p><p>Further extensions of this work can explore an integrated tube-linking algorithm and faster feature extraction backbones.

Isn&#x2019;t it? &#x1F609;</p><p>So the basic idea of cloud computing is a way of using I.T. with following important traits.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="641" height="361" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-VPTDOCbtNRQSOwWmw_zERw-1.png 641w"></figure><p>You can allocate resources as much as you want without any human intervention. Only you have to do is to use an interface, then you will get all the facilities such as storage and processing power. You can access your allocated resources any where in the world. May be your allocated resources are located in a different part of the world. </p><p>Elasticity is a very important facility. You can scale your resources as you want quickly and more importantly you pay for what you are using. If you are not using a resource anymore, you don&#x2019;t pay.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s it .. !! You know now the basic idea of cloud computing with GCP.</p><p>There are several GCP computing architectures. You can use any of them as per your requirement.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="646" height="365" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-9hWmMCwMwKRqQpVKybgxZA.png 646w"></figure><ul><li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Provides raw compute,storage and network facilities and you have to pay what you allocate.</li><li>PaaS (Platform as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;This binds the application code to libraries that allows you to access the resources what your application needs and you pay what you use.</li><li>Saas (Software as a Service)&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Many applications like Gmail,Google Drive and othre GSuit applications based on this architecture</li></ul><p>You do not need to worry about the resource provisioning at all !!</p><p>In network perspective, did you know the 40% of day-to-day internet traffic is handled by Google? Google network is designed to provide customers the highest possible throughput while providing the lowest possible latency. To provide such an amazing throughput and latency Google uses so called &#x201C;Edge Network system&#x201D; to cite content near the end users.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see how the GCP is organized.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="647" height="368" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-o5asfkzuXHACBYBm-b1GrQ.png 647w"></figure><p>Zone is the deployment area of the GCP.When you want to run a Virtual Machine (VM) in GCP, that would be placed on a zone you defined. Region is created using several zones. Regions are located in several geographical locations with round trip network latency under 5ms !! If you need to establish an application with high availability you should establish your application in multiple zones.That allows you to provide the service continuously without any failure. Google provides multi region resource allocation facility. Which means your resources are located at least two geographically different locations which are 160 km apart. The most important thing is you can use resources located in multiple regions for the sake of virtualization.</p><p>Google always thinks about the environment too.Running many servers full of resources requires very high power consumption(approx. 2% of world electricity).For that google build their data centers near regenerative energy sources like sea and 100% carbon neutral since 2007. A great example provides by the data center located in Finland.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/1-Q2gALaR8Qkb-boBWCiHwBA.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Google Cloud Platform 101" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"><figcaption>Data center in Finland</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, We&#x2019;ve reached to the end of &#xA0;the introduction to GCP article. Before I end this, let&#x2019;s talk about the security of the GCP.</p><p>Since millions of users use GCP, security is essential. Google make their own custom servers with a high hardware security chip named &#x201C;Titan&#x201D;. These servers use cryptographic signatures to make sure the correct software is booted. There are several layers of security in these servers which can be accessed by a very few of google employees.Then how the servers communicate each other securely? For that google uses a cryptographic remote procedure called data-on-the network. GCP encrypts all our PC traffic while flowing. In the Google logging page you need more than your username and password.Google uses an intelligent system to challenge users for additional information based on several risk factors such as a device logged in your account in a suspicious time and in a different location. Google allows you to use two-factor authorization to sign in. Inside the google infrastructure the intelligence system warns you about any suspicious activity.Not only that google conducts Red team exercises and simulated attacks to test and improve the responsiveness of the system.Every account needs U2F key to avoid phishing attacks.So you have nothing to worry about your security anymore.Google handles all !!</p><p>So we have discussed about some basics and techniques that we should know when we step into the GCP world. Let&apos;s talk more about GCP later. Till then Good Bye !!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
