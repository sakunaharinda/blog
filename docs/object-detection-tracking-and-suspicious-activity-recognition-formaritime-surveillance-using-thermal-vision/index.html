            <p></p><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><p>In a world of a globalized economy, maritime surveillance is a crucial element. Today maritime transportation is considered to carry more than 90% of long-distance world trade. Due to this rapid growth in marine traffic, security and safety have arisen as key issues. Along with that, real-time detection of maritime activities has become essential to monitor and control fishing activities, smuggling, human trafficking, and maritime pollution. Sri Lanka is a country where most coastal families depend on a daily wage incurred by fishing and the safety of these fishermen is crucial not only to themselves but also to their families. Additionally, during the recent past, Sri Lankan Navy has seized many large consignments of drugs during a short period of time within its maritime borders.</p><p>With this project, we propose a system that is capable not only to detect objects within the surveillance area but also to detect a set of pre-identified suspicious activities happening within the borders. We believe this will be an ideal replacement to the current system available which is to manually detect both objects and classify activities as suspicious or not. With the detection of any such suspicious activities, the system is capable of alerting the relevant authorities in real-time which makes it superior to the available traditional method with an additional benefit of increased safety of security personnel. One key objective of this project is to be able to detect both objects and activities happening at any time of the day. Hence, thermal imagery is used for the development of the models and for real-time detection.</p><p>Many of the currently available systems are limited to object detection in marine<br>environments using RGB imagery while activity detection and object tracking<br>as maritime surveillance is not a very common area of research. With this project, we propose a novel deep learning solution that is capable of object detection, activity detection, tracking, and early identification of suspicious activities using thermal images in maritime environments.</p><p>The final solution will run on inference hardware where the video feed from the thermal camera will be fed into our proposed system which is capable of carrying out the above-mentioned tasks and visualize the results on the user interface developed.</p><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><h3 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-11.53.10.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1392" height="666" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-11.53.10.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-11.53.10.png 1000w, ../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-11.53.10.png 1392w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>System Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed system consists of the following components: </p><ul><li>The Thermal Camera that captures a thermal feed.</li><li>On each of the frames fed by the thermal camera, the object detection algorithm runs and detects objects and sends the information of the object locations (bound-ing box coordinates) to the object tracking algorithm.</li><li>The object tracking algorithm keeps a track of all objects in the scene.</li><li>The tracked objects and the temporal information are sent to the activity detectionalgorithm to detect whether any actions are taking place and if so whether theyare suspicious or not.</li><li>Outputs of each of these algorithms are sent to the user interface to be recorded and monitored.</li></ul><h3 id="thermal-camera">Thermal Camera</h3><p><a href="https://www.flir.com">FLIR</a> M232 thermal camera that is specifically designed for marine applications is selected to capture a thermal video feed.  Some key specifications are given in the table below.  We use the real time streaming protocol (RTSP) to stream thermal video from the camera to the user interface.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.00.50.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1348" height="1224" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.00.50.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.00.50.png 1000w, ../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.00.50.png 1348w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Camera Specifications</figcaption></figure><h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3><p>For the key target deliverables in our work, we have used publicly available datasets to train and check the accuracy of our own algorithms and to compare the effectiveness ofeach different work type.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.06.38.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1210" height="824" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.06.38.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.06.38.png 1000w, ../content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-12-at-12.06.38.png 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Datasets for Maritime Object Detection</figcaption></figure><h3 id="object-detection">Object Detection</h3><p>Our system first requires detecting objects in the maritime environment that are laterused by the object tracking algorithm to set the heuristic bounding boxes to commencetracking.  Deep Learning based object detection  has recently become highlypopular owing to its high accuracy and high inference speed compared to contemporaryimage processing methods.

The project goes on to develop the application as far as is possible given the limited data available for training and testing the developed algorithms. Additionally, the research work carried out achieves significant performance gains over existing real-time activity detection algorithms, extending the boundaries of deep learning techniques in the domain of activity detection. The completion of this system in its totality requires access to, and annotation of large volumes of potentially sensitive data. Obtaining and annotating this data will be a time-consuming and challenging task. However, given the success demonstrated so far, we believe that this system will have significant benefits for the Navy of Sri Lanka, and in general for the whole country.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>If you want checkout the code and the project report for a clear understanding visit my <a href="https://github.com/sakunaharinda/FYP-Maritime_Surveillance">github repository</a> and there you will find all the references to mentioned algorithms and frameworks.</p><p>So that's it !! I'm hoping to write another article about deep-learning based GUI designing using Python in the future. </p>
